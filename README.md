Kaggle Competition name - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/uw-madison-gi-tract-image-segmentation

Introduction:
In this competition, we create a model to automatically segment the stomach and intestines on MRI scans. The MRI scans are from actual cancer patients who had 1-5 MRI scans on separate days during their radiation treatment. The algorithm would be on a dataset of these scans to come up with creative deep learning solutions that will help cancer patients get better care.

Solution details:
Solution added here was a 3D image segmentation based on MONAI(Medical open network for Artificial Intelligence) framework - a freely available, community-supported, PyTorch-based framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging.
